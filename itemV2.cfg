[b]Changes:[/b]
-Boss Walls are removed
-Active Mods Menu is displayed everytime you are in the starting cutscene
-You can also type '/active_mods' in chat to bring up the view aswell

[b]To do:[/b]
-Figure out what to do with potions

-If you have to many mods enabled it will phase through some of the elements of the view, I need to fix this eventually but you need something like 13+ active mods for that to happen so... it's on the back burner

P.S. Big thanks Zaphio, couldn't have done this without him. Also thanks to propjoe for having his code on git hub, Robin, SkacikPL, SirAiedai, and everyone who helped me on the Vermintide Modders Discord.";
